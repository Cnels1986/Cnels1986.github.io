            This week I did the midterm project for the class. This project included everything we have learned in class so far this semester. I used HTML and its containing elements, CSS, SASS, responsive design, used Git and GitHub, as well as did code reviews and work in with my group on the project. This project was made easier by planning better at the beginning. Figuring out what parts of the different sites were the same and could use the same CSS styling made my job a lot easier. The use of variables in SASS also made making changes to different parts of the project easy, this included the fonts and colors used. To do format some of the things for this project I had to study up on flexbox. The website Flexbox Froggy helped me a lot to figure this out.

            For this project, I also implemented a burger bar navigation menu for the mobile version of the webpages. This navigation bar a lot longer than I thought thanks to using JavaScript. The directions werenâ€™t too clear and it took some Google searching to find that I needed to download and like the JQuery file to my HTML as well as my JavaScript file. Editing the example that was given I was able to manipulate the size, font, color, etc. to make it work in the mobile version of the website.

            Working on this project in groups and using GitHub for code reviews helped me realize how important it can be. While I did not have much problem with the project, doing code reviews let me help team members. I spent a good portion of the week helping them, which in turn gave me more experience in finding where an error may occur and helped me pick out typos of misspellings easier.
