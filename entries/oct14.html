          <h2>SASS/SCSS</h2>

          <p class="popit">This week I was introduced to SASS or SCSS, not sure what’s the difference. After messing around a bit with it and doing the Codecademy on SASS I discovered it’s a way to create CSS but simplifies it. It reminds me a lot like other programming language where now I can use variables to store values for different styles and use it through my different sass files. With the use of a separate sass file that only contains the variables I need to style the page; I can include it into every other sass file. This means I have a central variables file where if I would need to change a value of one of them, I’d only have to do it at one place instead of searching for every instance of that variable.
          </p>

          <p class="popit">Sass also now lets me break down the page styling into smaller parts, meaning it’s much easier to find what I need. Instead of having the all the CSS in one large, long file, I can break the SASS into various sections making it easy to manage. For example, the site I’m working on I have a SASS file for the header, hero, content, footer, etc. The code in these files is not very long so I don’t lose track of where I am or what I’m doing.
          </p>

          <p class="popit">Sass also lets me use multiple lines of code and call them wherever I need them, making it less code and again simplifying the process. Using the terminal, I am also able to set it up to monitor the main Sass file that includes all the different ones and when there is an update the terminal will automatically update the CSS file.
