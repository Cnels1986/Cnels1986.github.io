          <h2>Command Line &amp; Introduction to Javascript</h2>
          <p class="popit">This week I did work with the command line on the computer. This is a much more difficult way to navigate through files and manipulate them. Not sure how much I will be using it, unless it’s absolutely necessary.
          </p>
          <p class="popit">We have also begun to learn about JavaScript and begun practicing with that. Having experience with other programming languages has made diving into this easier than I thought. Since my brain has been programmed to think like a computer, I’m finding it easier to visualize how to do something and I able to get right to coding instead of having to write or draw everything out.
          </p>
          <p class="popit">The basic of JavaScript is somewhat like Java (even though I know they’re not the same). But there are variables which you don’t have to declare a datatype (which is nice) and the arithmetic functions all seem to be the same. One thing I did learn is that JavaScript has new thing to use for comparisons, ‘===’. This allows you to not only compare the values of two things, but also the type. I’m not entirely sure what the use of this is compared to the double equals sign, but I’m sure I’m eventually find out through practicing JavaScript.
