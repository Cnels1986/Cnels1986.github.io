          <h2>Responsive Webpages:</h2>
          <p class="popit">
            This week I got into learning about responsive webpages and how to implement it into my CSS and html. This allows me to set a desired width (or height Iâ€™m assuming) and when the window gets to that point, the CSS changes to format and make the site fit better. It can allow of essentially an entirely new website layout if desired. To achieve this, you must use the CSS code:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <pre>
      @media only screen and ()
      {
      }
            </pre>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="popit">And also add this code to the head of the html file:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <pre>

      < meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, intial-scale=1.0" >
            </pre>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="popit">
            These allow for responsive webpages. The @media line (media query) can be called for several different widths to accommodate different screen sizes the webpage might be viewed on.
          </p>
          <p class="popit">
            We also did a small workshop on creating a responsive grid based of a twelve-column layout. Each of the columns would increase by about 8%, where the twelfth column would be 100% of the screen width. Creating rows in between the different columns used allowed for multiple rows to be used. The variation of column widths did not matter except that they all had to add up to 100% for the row. This method of splitting up a webpage and making it responsive could prove very useful in to future once our projects become more and more advanced.
