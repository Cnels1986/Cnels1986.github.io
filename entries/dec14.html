            This semester overall went pretty well when it came to learning about front-end development. I did have some experience with programming in HTML, but it paled in comparison to what we learned. Between CSS, SASS, and JavaScript I felt pretty confident when it comes to creating these websites. Obviously more practice is desired, and Iâ€™m hoping to do some exercises during the break to keep my skills up.

            For next semester, I am hoping for more involved JavaScript for our projects. Some of the things that JavaScript appears the let you do for websites seems very interesting to me. I also hope that instead of replicating a website given to us, we will be able to design and build it only given the content, much like the first big project we did this semester for the CSET website.
