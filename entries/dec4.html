          <h2>Final Project</h2>
          <p class="popit">Currently we are working on completing the final project for the semester. We had finished it last week and thought that that was it, but the second part of the project was introduced last Friday. There is nothing really new with what was added, it just means a bit more programming. I am not entirely sure that was are implementing the pop-up menu things on the site correctly. We currently have each of them coded in the HTML and hide them using JQuery/Javascript. Depending on what button is clicked or what was picked, the needed popup will appear. </p>
          <p class="popit">If we are able to finish this project early (before next Thursday), I would like to look into more JQuery. The Javascript that I have been writing is some Frankenstein combination of that and JQuery. I seem to drift into and out of using JQuery and would like my code to be more consistent, mainly because JQuery makes it easier.
          </p>
          <p class="popit">I also need to work on using a styling guide and sticking to it. I like the idea of formatting the different CSS properties together depending on what their purpose is. But once I get into coding I lose focus on that and my CSS becomes a mess. My commenting has been getting better but I am still only commenting what a block of code does, not what each line does. This really hasnâ€™t hurt me yet, but I can see a point in the future where there could be issues with a lack of commenting.
