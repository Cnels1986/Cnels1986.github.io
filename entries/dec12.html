          <p class="popit">We have finished our final project for the CSET course. Even with the extra content added on late my group was able to complete the project early, with time to spare. While working on the project I was able to get a much better understanding of JQuery and JavaScript in general. I also managed to complete the CodeAcademy JQuery exercise which helped a lot with the project. I am hoping that next semester I will be able to get more into JQuery so I will be able to expand on what I can do with Javascript. Speaking of CodeAcademy, I also begun to learn React with an exercise they have on the site.

          <p class="popit">Getting back to the project, my group worked very well together. The only issue we really had was that I wanted to get everything done as fast as possible and as a result ended up doing work that had been assigned to other group members. I didnâ€™t mind doing it work, it was mainly to avoid being rushed or behind the final week of school with my other finals loaming. Github worked out very well, and there was not much issue with merge conflicts because of how well our communication was.
