        Today we discussed the various different properties that we all research and presented. These properties ranged from simple text formatting like text-align, columns, and text-decoration, to the move involved and interesting properties like transition and animation. I have a feeling that these two properties will be used a lot in my site navigation and links in future projects. The property blend-mode also have some potential to have enhance backgrounds of future projects.

        When researching my property (transition) this morning, I discovered how to use the box-shadow, but invert it so it shows on the inside of the element inside of the outside. This along with the transition property using the pseudo-class – active will let me create more interactive buttons. To invert the box shadow, the code is simply:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <pre>
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 20px black inset;
        </pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="popit">
        This will create a smooth box shadow within the element, much like a border but is does not increase the height and width of the element. Then using the code:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <pre>
  .elementClass.{
  transition: box-shadow 1s;
  }

  .elementClass:active{
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 20px black inset;
  }
        </pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="popit">
        This creates the tranistion when the element is clicked on. In addition, I found a way to make the code stand out in html, which I’ve been using in the previous examples. I currently do not know if this is the best way or correct way to do it, but I will find out in the coming days and correct my actions if needed.
      </p>
      <p class="popit">
        Finally, we have also learned about the CSS reset which I will be implementing into all my future projects and making it a force of habit for front-end delopment.
