          <h2>CSS Properties:</h2>
          <p class="popit">
            Today we discussed the various different properties that we all research and presented. These properties ranged from simple text formatting like text-align, columns, and text-decoration, to the move involved and interesting properties like transition and animation. I have a feeling that these two properties will be used a lot in my site navigation and links in future projects. The property blend-mode also have some potential to have enhance backgrounds of future projects.

            When researching my property (transition) this morning, I discovered how to use the box-shadow, but invert it so it shows on the inside of the element inside of the outside. This along with the transition property using the pseudo-class – active will let me create more interactive buttons. To invert the box shadow, the code is simply:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <pre>
      box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 20px black inset;
            </pre>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="popit">
            This will create a smooth box shadow within the element, much like a border but is does not increase the height and width of the element. Then using the code:
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <pre>
      .elementClass.{
      transition: box-shadow 1s;
      }

      .elementClass:active{
      box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 20px black inset;
      }
            </pre>
          </blockquote>

          <p class="popit">
            This creates the transition when the element is clicked on. In addition, I found a way to make the code stand out in html, which I’ve been using in the previous examples. I currently do not know if this is the best way or correct way to do it, but I will find out in the coming days and correct my actions if needed.
          </p>

            Finally, we have also learned about the CSS reset which I will be implementing into all my future projects and making it a force of habit for front-end development.
