          <h2>JQuery &amp; Flex</h2>
          <p class="popit">We are working on our final project for the semester and everything is going well. I did a little reading on JQuery and worked on the CourseAcademy thing for JQuery and got comfortable with the hiding and showing of objects. This is proving to be extremely helpful for the final project since we are switching to different content depending on what is clicked on. Using JQuery I am able to do the same thing with a fraction of the code needed using straight Javascript.

          <p class="popit">We also had a remote class last week before the Thanksgiving break that we tried to simulate working remotely. For my group, there wasnâ€™t much of an issue, just the initial setting up of the Google Hangouts and Slack. It was nice to work at home and not have to come into work, but I do realize that it could be pretty easy to get distracted and lose concentration.
          </p>
          <p class="popit">I have also embraced display: flex. It has made positioning everything much easier. While it has taken me some time to get use to using it, I have found that it saves me a lot of headaches formatting the CSS.
