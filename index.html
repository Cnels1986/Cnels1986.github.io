    <h1>The Digital Notebook of Chris Nelson</h1>
    <h2>Under Construction</h2>
    <p>
      The propose of this GitHub page is to track what I've been doing, learning, or anything that I found interesting. I will primarily be focusing on the langauges that I have dealt with while earning my degree: python, php, mysql, html, css/sass, javascript/jquery. But this is only the start, I hope to branch out to newer langauges once I get back into the swing of things. It is my hope that this website will constantly be evolving and improving the practice I hope to gain from this little endeavor. I hope to be able to use the site as a sort of digital notebook, where I can go back and check/refresh on the things that I have done.
